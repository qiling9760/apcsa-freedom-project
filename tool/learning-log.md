### 10/5/25:
I linked **Math.js** to my HTML file using CDN.
- `math.evaluate()` is solving the expression.
``` JS
var num = math.evaluate('(2+3)/4');
console.log(num); // 1.5
```
It can take in variables and solve.
``` JS
var x = {x:2};
var num = math.evaluate('(2*x)/4', x );
console.log(num)
```
The second argument need to be an object, like `{ x: 2 }`. It does not work when I just write `var x = 2`.
